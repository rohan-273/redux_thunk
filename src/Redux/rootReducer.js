// A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function
// that you will pass to createStore later on. That one root reducer function is
// responsible for handling all of the actions that are dispatched, and
// calculating what the entire new state result should be every time.

// and gathers their results into a single state object.
// This enables splitting up reducer logic into separate functions,
// each managing their own slice of the state independently.
const appReducer = combineReducers({
